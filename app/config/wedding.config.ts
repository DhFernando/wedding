  // Our Story
  story: {
    title: "Our Love Story",
    content: `It all began within the hallowed halls of the University of Sabaragamuwa, Sri Lanka, where two souls destined 
    to be together first crossed paths. What started as a beautiful friendship blossomed into something extraordinary — 
    late-night study sessions turned into endless conversations, shared laughter echoed through the campus corridors, 
    and before they knew it, their hearts had intertwined in the most magical way.
    
    Years of cherished friendship laid the foundation for a love that was meant to be. Like the gentle dawn that follows 
    the night, their love grew naturally, patiently, and beautifully. From best friends who knew each other's every dream 
    and fear, they became each other's forever — proof that the greatest love stories are written by destiny itself.`,
    quote: "From best friends to soulmates — our love story was written in the stars.",
